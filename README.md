# PresentationJS

PresentationJS is a HTML/JS framework for creating web presentations with HTML canvas.
The presentations are made using JavaScript and referenced from the main HTML file.
It may not have many of the features of computer applications such as PowerPoint or OpenOffice,
but it is easily accessible and can create a variety of modern presentations.
